 I. Width and Height
 -> A div can be called as a rectangle which has a width but no height.
 -For div to be visible, we must assign height and width to it and also the background color.

 II.color and background
 -> Color is related to text color where as background color refer to background color.

 III.units:-px,%,vh,vw,em,rem
 -> px:-1px pixel depends upon the screen resolution .
    It is not a good practice to use px but we csn use it some time.
    px get change depends upon the screen size.
    That leads to the scroller down the screen.

    % :- It depends upon the screen and its cahnge with respect to screen size.
    for example,if we give a div widht of 70% that means it is equal to 70% of its parent div.
    % takes the vale from its parent div

    vh & vw:-takes the value from the screen

    em:-depends upon the font size of the element ,if font-size of the element is 16 px and width and height of the element is 2em then the font size is 16*2 px==32px.

    rem:-its depend upon the root element i.e html

  IV.max width and max height of the element
  -> Max-Height or Max Width give a certain limit to the height and width of the element even if we increase the height or width of the element it does not get changed.
  vice-verse to min height and min width.
