 I. Width and Height
 -> A div can be called as a rectangle which has a width but no height.
 -For div to be visible, we must assign height and width to it and also the background color.

 II.color and background
 -> Color is related to text color where as background color refer to background color.

 III.units:-px,%,vh,vw,em,rem
 -> px:-1px pixel depends upon the screen resolution .
    It is not a good practice to use px but we csn use it some time.
    px get change depends upon the screen size.
    That leads to the scroller down the screen.

    % :- It depends upon the screen and its cahnge with respect to screen size.
    for example,if we give a div widht of 70% that means it is equal to 70% of its parent div.
    % takes the vale from its parent div

    vh & vw:-takes the value from the screen

    em:-depends upon the font size of the element ,if font-size of the element is 16 px and width and height of the element is 2em then the font size is 16*2 px==32px.

    rem:-its depend upon the root element i.e html

  IV.max width and max height of the element
  -> Max-Height or Max Width give a certain limit to the height and width of the element even if we increase the height or width of the element it does not get changed.
  vice-verse to min height and min width.

  V.Font family 
  ->To use font we can download the google font and we can just install it it our system.
    sytax:font-family:font name;

  VI.Font size 
  ->It is use to change the size of the font.
    Beat practice is that use vh as it get adjust as the screen-size get change.
    using px is not consider as good practice.
    sytax:font-size:5vw/60px
    other properties related to font:
    text-decoration:none,overline,underline,line-through.
    text-transform:capitalize,uppercase,lowercase,none.
    text-align:center,justify,left,right.
    font-weight:100,bold.
    line-height:1.2.

    VII.Padding.
    ->It is given to the element present inside the box.

    VIII.margin
    ->it is used to give space outside the box.
    sytax:-margin:30px i.e 30px on top and left of the box
    margin:-30px 20px means top&bottom-30px and 20px left&right.

    IX.border
    ->it is given to the element itself.

    X.Display
    two types:-block and inline
    ->html tags usually have two types block or inline.
    **Block
    if any element is a block element,it wont allow any other element beside him.
    to make it happen ,we have to make that element display:inline.
    Block will not allow anyone to come in front or back of the block element.
    **Inline
    if there is a space it will allow an element to be in it vacant space.
    but we cant change the height or width of the element
    **InlineBlock
    If we make an block an element an inline block the it will allow the element to be inline element.

    XI.position
    There are two type of position 
    1.position relative.
    2.position absolute.

    **Position relative
    Making a div position relative will not allow its child to move outside the parent element.

    **Position absolute
    Making a div position absolute will  allow its child to move over the entire screen.

    ##background
    We can add background image to our website
    sytax:background-image:url(images addresse)
          background-size: cover(to fit the background or the entire image).
          background-position:center(to see the centre part of the image).
          background properties itself have a lot of type
          1.background-image:url(images addresse)
          2.background-color:
          3.background:linear gradient()

          to make div center "OR" H1 do this
          *position:absolute
          *top=50%
          *left=50%
